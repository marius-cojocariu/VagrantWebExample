Vagrant Web Example
=================

Simple vagrant template for creating a php web development environment.

What it does: provisions the vagrant box with apache, php and mysql. Setups the correct permissions for required directories. Adds phpmyadmin to the mix.
Uses a collection of puppet modules from the puppet forge. All credits goes to them and the creators of vagrant.

Experimental, not working yet.
